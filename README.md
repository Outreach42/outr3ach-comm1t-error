## About

Currently this website just serves as a demo to teach login and authentication. It is aimed to be properly implemented in 2025 as a locally run website for students to try and compromise and get authentication details.

## Features

- Simple local run website
- No internet connectivity needed
- Highly customisable for tutors/devs for demos

## Installation

Currently relevant instructions have been provided in person to the relevant parties. However a separate repository has been set up for others to trial.
If using Linux use the commands below:

```bash
# Example installation commands or steps
$ git clone https://github.com/Outreach42/do_not_use_yet.git
$ cd do_not_use_yet
$ npm install```

## Disclaimer

To the dev team: Please be careful when committing updates! We've already had a couple instances of devs accidentally committing their local passwords which could compromise their accounts!!
Also if I get one more person committing memes to the assets folder so help me-
