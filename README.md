This is a repository for the Institute internship development team. It contains the general folder architecture of the system as well as key files that all computers of the Institute have. Interns can also add their own files if they want others to pull the files and test on the system.

## History

Going through system reforms means that personal devices can not connect to their provided computers in the Institute. As a last minute alternative we have simply uploaded the general folder hierarchy and structure that all Institute computers have in this respository so that interns working at home can continue their software development while keeeping the folder structure in mind. Hopefully all revisions to the system architecture will be completed within the next couple of months and this repository will become redundant.

## Warnings

As this will likely be your first time using GitHub, be careful of what you commit! It is crucial that you do not upload any confidential information accidentally as GitHub tracks everything and in turn we may need to remake the repository.
Whatever you do, do NOT commit `system/network_pass` so help me god-
